# Cordel Mobile App - Bachelor Project at NTNU

## Overview

Welcome to the Cordel Mobile App repository, part of a bachelor project in Computer Engineering at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). This repository is maintained by a student team tasked with developing a mobile application as a component of a testing environment for the service we are creating for Corder. The service is to report a error to developers in the exact state the user encountered the error.

## Project Description

The Cordel Mobile App is designed to facilitate error reporting by allowing users to send error logs directly from their mobile devices. The error logs, in the form of raw SQL files, are transmitted to the Cordel developers' admin website. Developers can then access and download these files to diagnose the reported issues, making the troubleshooting process efficient and user-centric.
